								UK study finds biomethane not viable for mass home heating
							</h2>
							<p>
								<strong>Innowatt highlights:</strong> Biomethane was seen as a
								potential flexibility source, but this new report shows its
								limits. It reinforces the need for electrification and smart
								load management — exactly where Innowatt’s technology helps UK
								businesses.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>News:</strong> A new report commissioned by the MCS
								Foundation, authored by Regen, concludes that biomethane will
								not scale to serve most households in the UK as a replacement
								for gas. Even under optimistic assumptions, biomethane might
								meet only up to 18% of current gas demand by 2050. Experts
								recommend prioritising heat pumps and electrification.
